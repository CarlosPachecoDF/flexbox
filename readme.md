Proccess of creating the responsive layout:
* Header: The header section is centered horizontally
* Navigation: The navigation menu items are arranged horizontally using flexbox with 'display:flex' and 'list-style:none'
* Main Content and sidebar: The main content and sidebar are designed to have a flexible layout by using 'display:flex' for the main container and 'flex:3' for the 'content' container and 'flex:1' for the sidebar container. The 'flex-wrap:wrap' is applied to allow the content and sidebar to wrap to a new line on smallers screens
* Footer: The content in the footer section is aligned horizontally 
* Media queries: A media querie is defined to target specific screens widths. At '768px' breakpoint, the header and navigation layout are adjusted to a vertical orientation, the font size and spacing of navigation links are modified for better touch access, and the main content and sidebar are atacked in a column layout
* Testing and refinement: The layout is tested on different screen sizes and devices using browser developer tools to ensure it adapts and responds correctly. Necessary adjustments are made to optimize the responsiveness for a seamless user experience.
